# Capabilities matrix (v1, F1)

Component, capability and reason. Reviewed at every phase.

- ibexwalld: root, no extra capability set yet. Writes only paths declared
  by plugin manifests, via openat2 with RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS. Needs
  CAP_NET_ADMIN once nft executors run in a VM-tested phase (F3+).
  The hardened unit (Appendix G) is not yet installed by the VM suite,
  which runs the daemon directly; unit validation with
  `systemd-analyze security` lands with packaging (F10).
- ibexwall-exec: no capabilities; runs in a transient unit (Type=oneshot,
  NoNewPrivileges, ProtectSystem=strict, ProtectHome=yes, PrivateTmp,
  SystemCallFilter=@system-service, RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX
  AF_NETLINK) with ReadWritePaths limited to one transaction.
- ibexctl: unprivileged. Connects to the 0666 socket; every method is
  authorized by polkit.
- Plugins (dev.echo): no capabilities, `DynamicUser` unit text generated
  from the manifest and covered by tests. In F1 the VM runs the plugin as
  a direct child of the daemon; unit-based launch arrives with packaging.
- polkit subject: `unix-process` with pid and start-time (ADR-0025).
  pidfd subjects remain a tracked follow-up.
- ibexwall-dns (user `ibexwall-dns`): `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` only, no
  privileges to write outside `/var/lib/ibexwall/blocklists`; exposure 1.4
  in `systemd-analyze security --offline`.
- ibexwall-dns-failsafe (oneshot, root): `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and netlink only
  to delete IbexWall's own nftables chain, plus write access to
  `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d`; exposure 1.8.
